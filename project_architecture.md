Based on your project tree, the architecture aligns with a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. Below is a detailed breakdown of your project’s structure, followed by what you should include in your documentation to reflect the design accurately.

Project Architecture Overview

1. Directory Structure Overview

The project is divided into multiple components:

	•	Frontend: Located under platform/backend/frontend/. Uses React for the client-side interface and Redux for state management.
	•	Backend: Located under platform/backend/. Built with Node.js and Express.js, which exposes RESTful APIs.
	•	Database Layer: Uses MongoDB for storing user, post, and profile information.
	•	Middleware: Contains authentication middleware to secure routes (auth.js).

2. Detailed Layer Breakdown

Frontend (React + Redux)

Location: platform/backend/frontend/

	•	src/actions: Contains Redux action creators for features like auth, posts, profile, and alert.
	•	src/components: Contains UI components divided into logical modules:
	•	auth: Login and Register forms.
	•	dashboard: Dashboard to display user profiles and experience.
	•	post and posts: Manage individual posts and the posts listing.
	•	profile-forms: Forms to add or edit profiles and experiences.
	•	profiles: Display a list of profiles and profile details.
	•	layout: Navbar, landing page, and alert components.
	•	src/reducers: Reducers that update Redux store state.
	•	src/store.js: Configures the Redux store.
	•	PrivateRoute.js: Protects private routes based on authentication status.

Backend (Express + Node.js)

Location: platform/backend/

	•	routes/api: Defines REST API endpoints for:
	•	auth.js: Authentication and login.
	•	posts.js: CRUD operations for posts.
	•	profile.js: User profiles and experience.
	•	users.js: User registration.
	•	models/: Mongoose schemas for User, Post, and Profile.
	•	middleware/auth.js: Verifies JWT tokens for protected routes.
	•	config/db.js: Connects the application to MongoDB.
	•	server.js: Entry point for the backend server.

3. API Flow

	•	Authentication: Login and token generation using JWT.
	•	Route: POST /api/auth
	•	Middleware: Secures routes with auth.js.
	•	Post Management: Users can create, delete, like, and comment on posts.
	•	Route Example: POST /api/posts
	•	Reducer Action: Updates state with GET_POSTS, ADD_POST, etc.
	•	Profile Management: Users can create or edit their profiles, and list other users’ profiles.
	•	Route Example: GET /api/profile/me

4. Data Flow Example

	1.	User logs in via the Login component.
	2.	Redux action (login) dispatches an API call to /api/auth.
	3.	Backend responds with a JWT token stored in localStorage.
	4.	Subsequent API requests include the JWT token in headers.
	5.	Redux reducers update the global state, reflecting the user’s login status and data.

5. Suggested Documentation Content

1. Introduction

	•	High-level overview of the project: Social media platform for sharing posts and user profiles.

2. Installation & Setup

	•	Instructions for setting up backend, frontend, and database.

3. API Documentation

	•	Describe all backend API endpoints (GET /api/posts, POST /api/auth).

4. Component Guide

	•	Overview of core components like Dashboard, PostItem, CommentForm.

5. State Management

	•	Explanation of how Redux handles global state, with examples.

6. Middleware and Authentication

	•	How JWT authentication works and secures routes.

7. Deployment Instructions

	•	Steps for deploying the frontend and backend separately.

This structure ensures your project is clear, maintainable, and easy to understand for future developers. If you need any specific section or customization in your documentation, feel free to ask!
